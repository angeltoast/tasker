# tasker
A simple reminder list of upcoming tasks written in Bash.
Tasker is still in early stages of development, so is lacking some
features. All uploaded code has been tested and works, but may have
bugs, and is not ready for general use.

As currently set up:
Tasker will display tasks for the current month and next month;
Tasks are held in a text file sorted in date order;

Tasker uses the Lister suite of functions to make console applications
more pleasing to the eye than plain Bash output. A copy of Lister is
included in the repository, with a simple reference guide.

In hand:
Facilities so the user can easily edit, add, and delete tasks and
specify repeats.
