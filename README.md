# tasker
A simple reminder list of upcoming tasks written in Bash.
Tasker is still in early stages of development, so is lacking some
features. All uploaded code has been tested and works, but may have
bugs, and is not ready for general use.

25 August 2021
Currently:
Tasker will display tasks for the current month and next month;
Tasks are held in a text file sorted in date order (dd/mm/yyy);
Menus allow quick access to features;
Functions to add, edit and delete records are started but incomplete.

Tasker uses the Lister suite of functions to make console applications
more pleasing to the eye than plain Bash output. A copy of lister.sh is
included in the repo, with a simple reference guide. As of 25 August
2021 Tasker has been written to use the new version 2.00 of Lister.
